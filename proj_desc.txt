PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

The AI Vision-based Online Cheating Interception and Detection (AVOID) project aims to address the growing concern of cheating in online environments by leveraging the power of artificial intelligence and computer vision technology. With the increasing popularity of online assessments, it has become crucial to develop robust mechanisms to detect and prevent cheating attempts. This project offers a comprehensive solution that combines advanced image processing algorithms and machine learning techniques to analyze real-time video streams and identify potential instances of cheating during online exams or assessments.

By utilizing AI vision-based techniques, the project provides a proactive approach to identify various cheating behaviors, including unauthorized resource access, use of electronic devices, collusion between test-takers, and suspicious behaviors.The system can detect anomalies in real-time by monitoring participants' actions, movements, and interactions with the digital environment. Leveraging computer vision algorithms, the system can accurately detect and track multiple individuals, extract meaningful visual features, and employ machine learning models to classify and flag potential cheating incidents. Through the integration of this solution, institutions and online platforms can enhance the integrity and fairness of their assessments while ensuring a secure and trustworthy testing environment for participants.
